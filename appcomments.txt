Can improve the overall styling and colors of the sphinx doc so it looks more pleseant.

In the tab for trends I want you to create sub tabs for data that would logically group together, if the data needs to be visualized in a larger format like the heatmap put it in it's own tab. I wan the heat map to look something like the one in the pasted images, just ensure it's readable.

I want the overall theme of the app to look like google, so there should be shadows when buttons are hovered over, buttons should also be rounded.

is it possible to review my current project structure. Is it properly configured? Should all my imports need the src prefix? Do I need the run_app.py or is it a band-aid fix?
